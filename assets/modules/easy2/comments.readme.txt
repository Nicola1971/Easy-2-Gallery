NEW COMMENTS PROCESSING

Comments functionality has been removed from the class file and now has its own processor.
A new view processor snippet shows the comments on the landing page, and in the popup window.
Comments settings in the module are accepted, and can be overwritten on a per snippet basis if needed.
If reCaptcha is enabled in the config, that is used for the comment form. ( NEEDS TESTING )

To use comments, enable comments in the e2g settings. This will produce an icon in the bottom right
of your thumbnails which is a link to the comments opoup.
example doc  snippet call:

[!easy2? &gid=`2` &showonly=`images` &landingpage=`47`!]


To turn off comments on specific galleries, use the following:
&ecm       enables comments ( 0 off - default | 1 on )

[!easy2? &gid=`2` &showonly=`images` &landingpage=`47` &ecm=`0`!]



Landing page:

(your e2g snippet call)
[!easy2? &landingpage=`47` &lp_img_src=`generated` &lp_w=`450` &lp_h=`450`!]

[!easy2gallery_landingpage_comments?
&ecl_page=`2`
&captcha=`1`
&comments_lang=``
&approved=`1`
&delay=`30`
!]


&ecl_page           how many comments per page ( defaults to e2g config )
&captcha            option to use evolution built in captcha ( 0 off - default | 1 on )
&captcha_tpl        name of captcha tpl Chunk - defaults to templates/default/captcha.tpl
&comments_lang      language for the comments ( default english )
&approved           option to auto approve comments ( 0 off - default | 1 on )
&delay              number of seconds between comment entries ( default 30 )



View processor:
This page uses the comment settings and is only seen if comments are enabled.
Clicking on the number of comments shown on the thumbnail image opens the viewer page
with the comments.
